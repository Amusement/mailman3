Mailman queue runner control
============================

Mailman has a number of queue runners which process messages in its queue file
directories.  In normal operation, a command line script called 'mailmanctl'
is used to start, stop and manage the queue runners.  mailmanctl actually is
just a wrapper around the real queue runner watcher script called master.py.

Because master.py runs in the foreground, we can't start it directly, so we'll
start it via mailmanctl.

    >>> from Mailman.tests.helpers import Watcher
    >>> watcher = Watcher()
    >>> watcher.start()

    >>> import os

    # This will raise an exception if the process doesn't exist.
    >>> os.kill(watcher.pid, 0)

It's also easy to stop the queue runners via the mailmanctl program.

    >>> watcher.stop()
    >>> os.kill(watcher.pid, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    OSError: [Errno ...] No such process
