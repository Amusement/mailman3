"""Initialize all global state.

Every entrance into the Mailman system, be it by command line, mail program,
or cgi, must call the initialize function here in order for the system's
global state to be set up properly.  Typically this is called after command
line argument parsing, since some of the initialization behavior is controlled
by the command line arguments.
