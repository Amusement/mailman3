    # http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=1193,31
    #
    # This sucks for us because the mailman.db file /must/ be group writable,
    # however even though we guarantee our umask is 002 here, it still gets
    # created without the necessary g+w permission, due to SQLite's policy.
    # This should only affect SQLite engines because its the only one that
    # creates a little file on the local file system.  This kludges around
    # their bug by "touch"ing the database file before SQLite has any chance
    # to create it, thus honoring the umask and ensuring the right
    # permissions.  We only try to do this for SQLite engines, and yes, we
    # could have chmod'd the file after the fact, but half dozen and all...
