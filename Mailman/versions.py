"""Routines which rectify an old maillist with current maillist structure.

The maillist .CheckVersion() method looks for an old .data_version
setting in the loaded maillist structure, and if found calls the
Update() routine from this module, supplying the list and the state
last loaded from storage.  (Th state is necessary to distinguish from
default assignments done in the .InitVars() methods, before
.CheckVersion() is called.)

For new versions you should add sections to the UpdateOldVars() and the
UpdateOldUsers() sections, to preserve the sense of settings across
structural changes.  Note that the routines have only one pass - when
.CheckVersions() finds a version change it runs this routine and then
updates the data_version number of the list, and then does a .Save(), so
the transformations won't be run again until another version change is
detected."""
