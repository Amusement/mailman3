# flock.py: Portable file locking.  John Viega, Jun 13, 1998


"""Portable (?) file locking with timeouts.  
This code should work with all versions of NFS.
The algorithm was suggested by the GNU/Linux open() man page.  Make
sure no malicious people have access to link() to the lock file.

# to be done with the lock, so if he needs more time than the other
