"""Do more detailed spam detection.

This module hard codes site wide spam detection.  By hacking the
KNOWN_SPAMMERS variable, you can set up more regular expression matches
against message headers.  If spam is detected, it is held for approval (see
Hold.py).

TBD: This needs to be made more configurable and robust.

# the given header in the current message, then it is flagged as spam.  header
# can be None to indicate regex search of the body of the message.  Note that
# the more searching done, the slower this whole process gets.
