# Authentication contexts.
#
# Mailman defines the following roles:

# - User, a normal user who has no permissions except to change their personal
#   option settings
# - List creator, someone who can create and delete lists, but cannot
#   (necessarily) configure the list.
# - List moderator, someone who can tend to pending requests such as
#   subscription requests, or held messages
# - List administrator, someone who has total control over a list, can
#   configure it, modify user options for members of the list, subscribe and
#   unsubscribe members, etc.
# - Site administrator, someone who has total control over the entire site and
#   can do any of the tasks mentioned above.  This person usually also has
#   command line access.
