"""Incoming queue runner."""

# A typical Mailman list exposes seven aliases which point to four different
# wrapped scripts.  E.g. for a list named `mylist', you'd have:
#
# mylist         -> post
# mylist-admin   -> bounces
# mylist-request -> mailcmd
# mylist-join    -> mailcmd
# mylist-leave   -> mailcmd
# mylist-owner   -> mailowner
# mylist-bounces -> bounces
#
# mylist-request is a robot address; its sole purpose is to process emailed
# commands in a Majordomo-like fashion.  mylist-admin is supposed to reach the
# list owners, but it performs one vital step before list owner delivery - it
# examines the message for bounce content.  mylist-owner is the fallback for
# delivery to the list owners; it performs no bounce detection, but it /does/
# look for bounce loops, which can occur if a list owner address is bouncing.
# mylist-bounces is a reception robot that receives all normal delivery
# bounces.  Its messages are not handled by the incoming qrunner.
#
# So delivery flow of messages look like this:
#
# joerandom ---> mylist ---> list members
#    |                           |
#    |                           |[bounces]
