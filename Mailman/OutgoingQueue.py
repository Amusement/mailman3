"""Queue up posts if the SMTP connection fails."""
#
# messages are queued before a delivery attempt takes place
# this ensures that should the system fail for some reason,
# the run_queue process will make delivery attempts later.
#
# so q files have 2 possible states - those that are queued because
# they are currently being delivered by the initial delivery attempt
# and those that are queued because the first delivery attempt has
# failed.  the former state is indicated by the fact that the filename
# is setuid.  all queue entries in the latter state are not setuid and
# have data in them.  Since there's no way in python to create a file
# that is setuid at creation time, all files that are empty are
# considered to be in the first state (after the open call but before
# the chmod call).

#
# protection from multiple processQueue procedures occuring
# simultaneously is enforced by setting a lock file forcing
# only one such process to happen at a time.
