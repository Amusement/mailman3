                 because it reduces the amount of traffic between Mailman and
                 the mail server.

                 <p>However, some lists can benefit from a more personalized
                 approach.  In this case, Mailman crafts a new message for
                 each member on the regular delivery list.  Turning this on
                 adds a few more expansion variables that can be included in
                 the <a href="?VARHELP=nondigest/msg_header">message header</a>
                 and <a href="?VARHELP=nondigest/msg_footer">message footer</a>
                 but it may degrade the performance of your site as
                 a whole.

                 <p>You need to carefully consider whether the trade-off is
                 worth it, or whether there are other ways to accomplish what
                 you want.  You should also carefully monitor your system load
                 to make sure it is acceptable.

                 <p>These additional substitution variables will be available
                 for your headers and footers, when this feature is enabled:

                 <ul><li><b>user_address</b> - The address of the user,

                     <li><b>user_delivered_to</b> - The case-preserved address
                         that the user is subscribed with.
                     <li><b>user_password</b> - The user's password.
