"""Master queue runner watchdog.

This script should be started from an init script.  It simply makes sure that
the various long-running qrunners are still alive and kicking.  It does this
by forking the individual qrunners and waiting on their pids.  When it detects
a subprocess has exited, it will restart it.  Sending a SIGINT to the qrunner
process raises a KeyboardInterrupt, which is caught and propagated to each
subprocess.

You can substitute your own queue management system for qrunner, or you can
edit this file to tailor which Mailman qrunners actually get started.  This
way you can say, drop in your own archiver qrunner or your own outgoing
qrunner, or define entirely new qrunner paths through the system.  The only
one that's required is the IncomingRunner, which handles passing a message
through the Mailman system.

The current set of queues are:

    - incoming queue for messages from the MTA, Usenet, or other injection
      processes.

    - outgoing queue for messages processed by Mailman and intended to go out
      through the MTA to final destination recipients

    - news queue for messages processed by Mailman and destined for posting
      via NNTP.

    - archive queue for messages processed by Mailman and destined for the
      internal or external archiver.

    - bounce queue for bounce messages to be processed by the detector

This subsystem is in a bit of flux and should be considered experimental.
Specifically, we'd like to support non-Mailman queue processors and a more
flexible queuing subsystem (e.g. for authentication queues, etc.)

When run as a script, the follow usage is allowed:

Usage: qrunner [options]

Options:

    -r runnername
    --runner=runnername
        Run the named qrunner exactly once.  runnername is the name of a
        module in the Mailman.Queue package, but it should be just the first
        part of the package name (i.e. sans `Runner').  E.g.

            qrunner -r Virgin

        runs the Mailman.Queue.VirginRunner qrunner once.  With no --runner
        flag, this starts the qrunner watchdog master script.

    -b/--background
        Run the qrunner process in the background.  Only effective if --runner
        option is not used.

    -n/--no-restart
        Don't restart queue runners when they exit because of an error.

    -h/--help
        Print this help message and exit.
