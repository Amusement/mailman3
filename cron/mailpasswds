This is a reminder, sent out once a month, about your %s
mailing list memberships.  It includes your subscription info and

%s
You can visit the URLs to change your membership status or configuration,
including unsubscribing, setting digest-style delivery or disabling
delivery altogether (e.g., for a vacation), and so on.

In addition to the URL interfaces, you can also use email to make such
changes.  For more info, send a message to the '-request' address of the
list (for example, %s-request@%s) containing just
the word 'help' in the message body, and an email message will be sent to
you with instructions.

If you have questions, problems, comments, etc, send them to
