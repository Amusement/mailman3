Here is a list of changes between Mailman releases.  Note that this
list was started for the 1.0beta9 release.

==========
Differences between 1.0b8 and 1.0b9

- New bin scripts: clone_member, list_members, add_members (a
  consolidation of convertlist and populate_new_list which have been
  removed).

- Two new readmes have been added: README.LINUX and README.QMAIL

- New configure option --with-cgi-ext which can be used if your Web
  server requires extensions on CGI scripts.  The extension must
  include a dot (e.g. --with-cgi-ext=".cgi").

- Many bug fixes, including the setgid problem that was causing mail
  to be lost on some versions of Linux.
