This is Mailman, maillist management software written mostly in
Python.  Mailman was originally developed by John Viega.  Subsequent
development (through version 1.1) was by Ken Manheimer.  Currently,
Mailman development is a group effort, led by John Viega, Ken
Manheimer and Barry Warsaw.  

Initial version of Mailman (v. 0.9) written by John Viega Dec 12-15
1996.  Mailman 1.0b3, 2, and 1.1 developments by ken manheimer, 4/98
and 5/98.

We recommend that you join the mailman user's mailing list.  You may
do so at the following web address (which also is an example of the
system in action):

	    http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users

For anyone interested in joining the development crowd, or just
tracking the progress, there's a developer's mailing list:

See file DONE for info on changes since v. 0.9

Features:
  o Most standard mailing list features, including:
	moderation, mail based commands, digests, etc...
  o An extensive web interface customizable on a per-list basis.
  o Web based list administration interface for *all* admin-type tasks.
  o Automatic web based hypermail-style archives (using pipermail or
    other external archiver), including provisions for private archives
  o Smart bounce detection and correction
  o Fast bulk mailing
  o Smart spam protection
  o Extendable logging
  o Multiple list owners and moderators
  o Optional MIME-Compliant digests
  o Nice about which machine you subscribed from if you're from the
	right domain.

Requirements:
  You must be root on a machine running a mail transport program that
	uses an /etc/aliases file, and has a sendmail executable (smail
	should be OK).  (We will soon be switching over to use a direct
	SMTP connection to whatever you have running on port 25.)
  The machine really needs to have a web server in order to configure lists.

Install:
  o Make sure Python is installed as /usr/local/bin/python (currently
	hardcoded -- this obviously needs to change, and should be
	handled by a config program)
  o As root, add a mailman user
  o As mailman, copy the mailman dir to /home/mailman.  Currently the
    system requires the source be located there.  [I've been running
    with the untarred mailman dir as a subdir of /home/mailman, so eg
    maillist.py, the main mailman list object module, is situated as
    /home/mailman/mailman/modules/maillist.py.]
  o As mailman, in /home/mailman make public_html, cgi-bin, and logs
    directories.  Chmod them g+sw.
  o As mailman, in /home/mailman make archives/private and archives/public
    directories.  Chmod them g+sw.
  o Copy /home/mailman/mailman/misc/Cookie.py to /home/mailman/cgi-bin 
  o As root, Configure your web server to give /home/mailman/cgi-bin
    perms to run cgi in the cgi-bin dir, and restart the web server.
    The line you should add should look something like:
	Exec    /mailman/*      /home/mailman/cgi-bin/*
	or:
	ScriptAlias /mailman/   /home/mailman/cgi-bin/

    (Or whatever is equivalent for your web server)
  o As root, edit /home/mailman/mailman/src/*.c and edit the UID and
    GID const lines as appropriate.  (See Troubleshooting, below, for
    hints about determining the proper settings when you're unsure.)
  o As root, cd to /home/mailman/mailman/src and type: make
  o As root, Add mailman as a trusted mail user.  This is usually done
    by adding: Tmailman to /etc/sendmail.cf under the line: Troot
  o As root, Restart sendmail.
  o As mailman, cd to /home/mailman/mailman/cron, and add crontab.in
    as your crontab.  (probably done w/: crontab crontab.in)
  o Edit mailman/modules/mm_cfg.py - if you don't already have one, make a
    copy from mailman/modules/mm_cfg.py.dist.  Include settings in mm_cfg.py
    for any of the defaults in mm_defaults.py that you want to tailor
    for your site.
  o Create the site password, if you don't already have one, using
    'mailman/bin/mmsitepass password'.
  o Point external archiver at public and private archives (we recommend
    http://starship.skyport.net/crew/amk/maintained/pipermail.html ).

Adding a new list:
  o Run the program bin/newlist
  o Visit the list general admin page, and use the descriptions and
    the "details" help feature to understand the configuration settings.

List managers, note that:

  o Being a list administrator does not entail receiving the traffic - 
    you have to subscribe, as well.
  o Relevant urls - the DEFAULT_URL plus:
    - mailman/listinfo/listname for public view of list
    - mailman/admin/listname for options
    - mailman/admindb/listname for pending requests
    - and generally, mailman/listinfo for the list of (public) lists

Troubleshooting:

  If from the web you get "document contains no data":
  If mail isn't getting delivered:

    The cgi wrappers are failing.  Either a UID is wrong, or your web
    server / mailer has a non-standard name.

    If you're unsure about the proper settings, the cgi and mail
    wrapper programs use syslog to register mismatches, indicating the
    correct setting in the process.  You need to have syslog running
    and configured to log the mail.error log class somewhere - on sun
    systems, the line

      mail.debug		/var/log/syslog

    causes the messages to go to them in /var/log/syslog, for example.
    (The distributed syslog.conf forwards the message to the loghost,
    when present.  See the syslog man page for more details.)  If your
    system is set like this, if you get a failure trying to visit the
    mailman/listinfo web page and it's due to a UID or GID mismatch,
    then you should get an entry at the end of /var/log/syslog
    identifying the expected and received values.

  If the web pages hang:

    CERN web servers might leave python's running, and in some
    cases might hang the cgi completely.  In that case, switch to
    Apache.

  Check ~mailman/logs/error periodically:

    Many of the scripts have their stderr logged to
    ~mailman/logs/error, and some of the modules write caught errors
    there, as well, so you should check there at least occasionally to
    look for bugs in the code and problems in your setup.

    One thing that is *not* caught by stderr hook is syntax errors!
    However, most files can be run from the command line with no
    effect.  (The ones that will do stuff you want to avoid, like
    sending out spurious password reminders, are in the cron dir.)  So
    you can and should use the python interpreter to check the syntax
    of any changes before trying them out.

How to add a new user option

    You'll need to do some of these things and not others.

	1) Add a flag to mm_defaults.py, and mm_cfg.py.dist if it's
	   likely to require a custom value for each site.
	2) Add an entry to mm_html GetStandardReplacements name
	 & mapping, to enable referring to the value from mailman html.
	3) Add replacements lines to the cgi/options and cgi/listinfo
	   scripts, to hook the mailman html up with the option.
	4) For user-specific options, make SetUserOption calls in
	 & cgi/handle_opts.
	5) For user-specific options, add to 2 data structs at top of
	 &  mm_mailcmd.
	6) For user-specific options, add description to mm_mailcmd help
	7) Update templates if the options have replacements
	8) Use your option wherever appropriate...

Interactive python sessions with maillists

    You can do substantial things with maillists from th interpreter!
    Cd to the modules subdir and, with '.' on your pythonpath, start
    the interpreter and import maillist and mm_utils.  You can
    instantiate the maillist of your choice, eg for a list named
    postal:

>>> l = maillist.MailList('postal')
>>> l.Unlock()

    Don't do the Unlock() if you're going to be doing surgery on the
    list.  However, if the list is active, and you aren't going to be
    saving any changes, be sure to do the l.Unlock() immediately.
    Otherwise, anyone visiting a web interface involving the list, or
    postings going to the list, will be held awaiting the lock.

    Now you can examine various aspects of the list:

>>> l.members
['klm@python.org']
>>> l.digest_members
[]
>>> l.real_name
'Postal'
>>> l._internal_name
'postal'

    dir(l) will present the components of the list. maillists.py has
    the descriptions of many of the components, though some are defined
    in other modules.

    If you want to save changes, 'l.Save()' will do it.  It's a real
    good idea to play with trial lists, first, before doing surgery
    with this method on production lists.

    When you do get comfortable with it, you use it and a utility
    routine, mm_utils.mm_utils.map_maillists(), to do wholesale changes
    on all your lists.  It takes a function argument, and applies that
    function to every one of the lists on your system.  For instance,
    to get the names of all the lists on your system which are
    advertised:

>>> import maillist, mm_utils
>>> def advertised(l):
...    if l.advertised: return l.real_name
...
>>> filter(None, mm_utils.map_maillists(advertised))
['Mailman-developers', 'Meta-sig', 'Python-Help', 'C++-SIG',
'Matrix-SIG', 'DB-SIG', 'DO-SIG', 'Doc-SIG', 'GUI-SIG', 'Image-SIG',
'Objc-SIG', 'Plot-SIG', 'Pythonmac-SIG', 'String-SIG', 'Thread-SIG',
'Grail', 'XML-SIG', 'JPython-Interest']

    If you do list surgery with this mechanism, double check that
    you're doing what you intend before having the routine do l.Save()'s.
