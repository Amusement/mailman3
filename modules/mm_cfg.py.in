"""This is the module which take your site-specific settings.

From a raw distribution it should be moved to be named mm_cfg.py.  If you
already have an mm_cfg.py, be careful to add in only the new settings you
want.  The complete set of distributed defaults are in ./mm_defaults.  In
mm_cfg, override only those you want to change, after the

  from mm_defaults import *

line, below.

Note that these are just default settings - many can be overridden via the
admin and user interfaces on a per-list or per-user basis.

Note also that some of the settings are resolved against the active list
setting by using the value as a format string against the
list-instance-object's dictionary - see the distributed value of
DEFAULT_MSG_FOOTER for an example."""
