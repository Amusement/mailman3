This page contains the current set of administrative requests
requiring your approval for the mailing list <em>%(listname)s</em>.
First you will find the list of pending subscription requests (if
there are any), followed by any mailing list postings being held for
your approval.

<p>For each administrative request, please select the action to take
by choosing one of:

<ul>
<li><b>Defer</b> -- Defer your decision until later.  No action is
    taken for this request, but for held postings, you can still
    forward or preserve the message (see below).

<li><b>Approve</b> -- Approve the message, sending it on to the list,
    or for membership requests, approve the change in membership
    status.

<li><b>Reject</b> -- Reject the message, sending a rejection notice to
    the sender, and discarding the original message.  For membership
    requests, reject the change in membership status.  In this case,
    you should add a reason for the rejection in the accompanying text
    box.

<li><b>Discard</b> -- Throw away the original message, without sending
    a rejection notice.  For membership requests, this simply discards
    the request, again, without notice to the person making the
    request.
</ul>

<p>For held messages, turn on the <b>Preserve</b> option if you want
to save a copy of this message for the site administrator.  This is
useful for abusive messages.  Turn on the <b>Forward to</b> option,
and fill in the forwarding address if you want to forward the message
to someone else not on the list.

<p>When you're finished, click on the <em>Submit All Data</em> button
at the top or bottom of this page.  This button will submit all
selected actions for all administrative requests that you've made a
decision for.
