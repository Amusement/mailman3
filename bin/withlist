"""General framework for interacting with a mailing list object.

There are two ways to use this script: interactively or programmatically.
Using it interactively allows you to play with, examine and modify a MailList
object from Python's interactive interpreter.  To do this, run the script as
follows:

%% python -i bin/withlist [options] listname [args ...]

This will load the list object named by listname (required) into an object
called `m' in the global namespace.  It also loads the class MailList into the
global namespace.

Programmatically, you can write a function to operate on a MailList object,
and this script will take care of the housekeeping (see below for examples).
In that case, the general usage syntax is:

%% bin/withlist [options] listname [args ...]

Options:

    -l
    --lock
        Lock the list when opening.  Normally the list is opened unlocked
        (e.g. for read-only operations).  You can always lock the file after
        the fact by typing `m.Lock()'

        Note that if you use this option, you should explicitly call m.Save()
        before exiting, since the interpreter's clean up procedure will not
        automatically save changes to the MailList object (but it will unlock
        the list).

    --run [module.]callable
    -r [module.]callable
        This can be used to run a script with the opened MailList object.
        This works by attempting to import `module' (which must already be
        accessible on your sys.path), and then calling `callable' from the
        module.  callable can be a class or function; it is called with the
        MailList object as the first argument.  If additional args are given
        on the command line, they are passed as subsequent positional args to
        the callable.

        Note that `module.' is optional; if it is omitted then a module with
        the name `callable' will be imported.

        The global variable `r' will be set to the results of this call.

    --help
    -h
        Print this message and exit


Here's an example of how to use the -r option.  Say you have a file in the
Mailman installation directory called `listaddr.py', with the following
two functions:

def listaddr(mlist):
    print mlist.GetListEmail()

def requestaddr(mlist):
    print mlist.GetRequestEmail()

Now, from the command line you can print the list's posting address by running
the following from the command line:

%% bin/withlist -r listaddr mylist
Loading list: mylist (unlocked)
Importing listaddr ...
Running listaddr.listaddr() ...
mylist@myhost.com

And you can print the list's request address by running:

%% bin/withlist -r listaddr.requestaddr mylist
Loading list: mylist (unlocked)
Importing listaddr ...
Running listaddr.requestaddr() ...
mylist-request@myhost.com

As another example, say you wanted to change the password for a particular
user on a particular list.  You could put the following function in a file called `changepw.py':

import string

def changepw(mlist, addr, newpasswd):
    addr = string.lower(addr)
    if mlist.passwords.has_key(addr):
        mlist.passwords[string.lower(addr)] = newpasswd
        mlist.Save()
    else:
        print 'No address matched:', addr

and run this from the command line:
%% bin/withlist -l -r changepw mylist somebody@somewhere.org foobar
