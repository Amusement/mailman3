# This program gets called when the list admin posts a list of names
# to be subscribed on the admin page.  This is here because mailman
# needs to fork this off and make it do the work for the following
# reasons:
#
# 1) We need to fork so the web browser can return in a reasonable time
# 2) We need to run a ton of mailman processes to avoid holding the
# lock for an unreasonable amount of time.
