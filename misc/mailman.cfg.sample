"""This module contains your site-specific settings.

Use this to override the default settings in Mailman/Defaults.py.  You only
need to include those settings that you want to change, and unlike the old
mm_cfg.py file, you do /not/ need to import Defaults.  Its variables will
automatically be available in this module's namespace.

You should consult Defaults.py though for a complete listing of configuration
variables that you can change.

To use this, copy this file to $VAR_PREFIX/etc/mailman.cfg

Mailman's installation procedure will never overwrite mailman.cfg.
