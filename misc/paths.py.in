# This file becomes paths.py which is installed in may directories.  By
# importing this module, sys.path gets `hacked' so that the $prefix/Mailman
# directory is inserted at the start of that list.  That directory really
# contains the Mailman modules in package form.  This file exports two
# attributes that other modules may use to get the absolute path to the
# installed Mailman distribution.

# since the email package has some patches not included in 2.2 final (though
