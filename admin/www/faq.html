	1. If from the web you get "document contains no data", or
        if mail isn't getting delivered, or
        if you see "Premature end of script headers", or
        if you see "Mailman CGI error!!!"
	</strong></font>
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
      The most likely cause of this is that the GID that is compiled
      into the C wrappers does not match the GID that your Web server
      invokes CGI scripts with.  Note that a similar error could occur
      if your mail system invokes filter programs under a GID that
      does not match the one compiled into the C mail wrapper.

      <p>To fix this you will need to re-configure Mailman using the
      <tt>--with-cgi-gid</tt> and <tt>--with-mail-gid</tt> options.
      See <tt>INSTALL</tt> for details.

      These errors are logged to syslog and they do not show up in the
      Mailman log files.  Problems with the CGI wrapper do get
      reported in the Web browser though, and include the expected
      GID, so that should help a lot.

      You may want to have syslog running and configured to log the
      mail.error log class somewhere; on Solaris systems, the line

      <blockquote><pre>
          mail.debug                /var/log/syslog
      </pre></blockquote>

      causes the messages to go to them in <tt>/var/log/syslog</tt>, for
      example.  (The distributed syslog.conf forwards the message to
      the loghost, when present.  See the syslog man page for more
      details.)

      If your system is set like this, and you get a failure trying to
      visit the mailman/listinfo web page, and it's due to a UID or
      GID mismatch, then you should get an entry at the end of
      <tt>/var/log/syslog</tt> identifying the expected and received values.

	3. Check ~mailman/logs/error periodically...

	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
      Many of the scripts have their stderr logged to
      <tt>~mailman/logs/error</tt>, and some of the modules write caught errors
      there, as well, so you should check there at least occasionally
      to look for bugs in the code and problems in your setup.

      <p>One thing that is <em>not</em> caught by stderr hook is syntax errors,
      but any of these should have been caught in the installation
      phase, which byte-compiles all .py files in the distribution.
      There may be syntax errors lurking if you hacked the code, or in 
      the scripts that are not modules.

      <p>You can always use the Python module <tt>compile</tt> or
      <tt>compileall</tt>
      to force byte compilation of a file, or just fire up the Python
      interpreter and try importing the module!

      If you get exceptions in the log and/or Web pages, and these are
      complaining that files could not be opened, you might like to
      see which files Mailman is trying to open!

      <p>In Python 1.5.2, this will be a standard part of the exception
      message.  In Python 1.5.1 the best you can do is to comment out
      the code in <tt>$prefix/scripts/driver</tt> where it is redefining the
      built-in <tt>open()</tt> function.  This simulates what Python 1.5.2 will
      do when it raises an <tt>IOError</tt> exception, however this only works
      for <tt>open()</tt>.  While this is the most common case, Python 1.5.2
      will handle many other cases where files are unsuccessfully
      referenced.
