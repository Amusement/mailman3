<ul>
  <li>Most standard mailing list features, including list moderation,
    mail based commands, MIME and RFC 934 (plain) digests, and so on.

  <p><li>An extensive web-based user interface that is customizable on a
    per-list basis.  This allows users to manage their own
    subscriptions, with support for temporarily disabling their
    accounts, selecting digest modes, hiding their email addresses
    from other members, etc.

  <p><li>A web-based list administration interface for almost all
    admin-type tasks, including list configuration, moderation (post
    approvals), selection of posting and subscribing rules, management
    of user accounts via the web, etc.

  <p>Privacy features such as closed-subscriptions, private archives,
  private membership rosters, etc.

  <p><li>Automatic web-based Hypermail-style archiving, including
    provisions for private archives.  External archivers such as
    <a href="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html">MHonArc</a>
    can be easily integrated.
  
  <p><li>Integrated Usenet gatewaying.

  <p><li>Smart bounce detection with automatic disposition
    (i.e. configurable disabling, unsubscribing).

  <p><li>Integrated spam detection.

  <p><li>Integrated auto-replies.

  <p><li>Multiple list owners and moderators are possible.
  
  <p><li>Support for virtual domains.

  <p><li>Runs on most Un*x-like systems, compatible with most web
    servers and browsers, and most SMTP servers.  Requires Python
    1.5.2 or newer (works with Python 1.6 and 2.0).
