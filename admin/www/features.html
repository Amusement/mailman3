    mail based commands, digests (both MIME and `plain'), and so on.

    provisions for private archives.
  
  <p><li>Integrated gatewaying to and from Usenet.

    (i.e. configurable disabling, unsubscribing).

  <p><li>Direct SMTP delivery of messages, including integrated fast
    bulk mailing.

  <p><li>Smart spam protection.

  <p><li>Multiple list owners and moderators are possible.
