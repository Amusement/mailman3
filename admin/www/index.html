Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
each mailing list a web page, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the web.  Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the web.  Mailman also integrates most things
people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving,
mail-to-news
gateways, and so on. See the 
<a href="features.html">features page</a>
for a brief overview of features.<p>

Mailman has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.

<p>Mailman is free software.  It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.

<p>Mailman is brought to you by the <em>Mailman Cabal</em>, currently
composed of the following core developers: Barry Warsaw, Harald
Meland, Ken Manheimer, Scott Cotton, and John Viega.  Mailman was
originally written by John Viega.

<p>The Cabal would like to thank the following other developers for
their important contributions: The Dragon De Monsyne, Timothy
O'Malley, Balazs Nagy, Michael Mclay, Greg Stein, Gergely Madarasz,
Andrew Kuchling, Jeff Hahn.  <b>We have a extensive wish list and
welcome anyone else who would like to contribute!</b>

We have several mailing lists devoted to Mailman, which also provide a 
nice demonstration of Mailman!

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-announce">
    Mailman Announce</a> is a read-only list that you can subscribe to 
    if you are only interested in release notices and other important
    news.  Only the core Mailman developers can post messages to this
    list.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users">
    Mailman Users</a> is the mailing list to subscribe to if you are
    using Mailman at your site, and may have problems or questions
    relating to installation, use, etc.  We'll try to keep the deep
    technical discussions off this list.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers">
    Mailman Developers</a> is the mailing list to use if you are
    interested in helping us develop Mailman, discuss future
    directions, etc.  This is the list for more in-depth technical
    issues.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-checkins">
    Mailman Checkins</a> is an adjunct list to the publically
    accessible read-only CVS repository.  This list is for the
    hardcore developers, or anybody else submitting patches, since we
    really prefer such patches to be generated against the latest
    snapshot.  This is a read-only list; only the core Mailman
    developers can post messages to this list.  There is no archive.

    <p>You may also want to find a project on our Mailman
<a href="todo.html">TODO list</a>.

Mailman was featured in a
<a href="http://www.sunworld.com/swol-03-1999/swol-03-mailtools.html">
cover story article</a> in the March 1999 issue
of SunWorld.  The article was written by Cameron Laird and Kathryn
Soraiz.

<p>Mailman was briefly mentioned in
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/sr/stories/issue/0,4537,387506,00.html">
a ZDNet article</a> on Linux.  This was picked up by
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/244979.asp">MSNBC</a> (I won't
comment on the irony there).
