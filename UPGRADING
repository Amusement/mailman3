Mailman is beta software.  Because it's development tree is always
immediately available via anonymous CVS, it is sometimes in a less
stable state.  Contained below are some instructions that should make
it easier for you to upgrade between beta releases.  We intend to
improve the upgradeability of Mailman in the future.

- If upgrading from version 1.0b4 or earlier, templates need to be
  moved.  For each list, move $prefix/templates/<listname>/* to
  $prefix/lists/<listname>.  Be careful about stomping template
  changes that your list managers have changed!  (Only the
  options.html template changed from 1.0b5 to 1.0b6.)

- If you are upgrading to 1.0b6 from an earlier version, and you have
  archiving turned on, you will need to move and or merge your mbox
  archives.  1.0b6 has a different layout for its archiving mbox and
  Pipermail indexes, which are now integrated in Mailman.

  Previous versions of Mailman stored public mboxes in
  $prefix/archives/public/<listname> and private mboxes in
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname>.  No provision was made to
  merge private and public archives when their permissions changed.

  Mailman now stores a consolidated mbox archive in
  $prefix/archives/private/<listname>.mbox/<listname>.mbox and uses
  symbolic links to provide public access to the mbox when permitted.

  If you want to retain your archive across the upgrade, move your old 
  mbox to the new locations.

  TBD: We need to deal with batch creation of Pipermail archive from
  an old existing mbox.
