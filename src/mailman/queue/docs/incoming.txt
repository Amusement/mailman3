=========================
The incoming queue runner
=========================

This runner's sole purpose in life is to decide the disposition of the
message.  It can either be accepted for delivery, rejected (i.e. bounced),
held for moderator approval, or discarded.

The runner operates by processing chains on a message/metadata pair in the
context of a mailing list.  Each mailing list may have a 'start chain' where
processing begins, with a global default.  This chain is processed with the
message eventually ending up in one of the four disposition states described
above.

    >>> mlist = create_list('test@example.com')
    >>> print mlist.start_chain
    built-in


Accepted messages
=================

We have a message that is going to be sent to the mailing list.  This message
is so perfectly fine for posting that it will be accepted and forward to the
pipeline queue.

    >>> msg = message_from_string("""\
    ... From: aperson@example.com
    ... To: test@example.com
    ... Subject: My first post
    ... Message-ID: <first>
    ...
    ... First post!
    ... """)

Inject the message into the incoming queue, similar to the way the upstream
mail server normally would.

    >>> from mailman.inject import inject_message
    >>> inject_message(mlist, msg)

The incoming queue runner runs until it is empty.

    >>> from mailman.queue.incoming import IncomingRunner
    >>> from mailman.testing.helpers import make_testable_runner
    >>> incoming = make_testable_runner(IncomingRunner, 'in')
    >>> incoming.run()

And now the message is in the pipeline queue.

    >>> pipeline_queue = config.switchboards['pipeline']
    >>> len(pipeline_queue.files)
    1
    >>> incoming_queue = config.switchboards['in']
    >>> len(incoming_queue.files)
    0
    >>> from mailman.testing.helpers import get_queue_messages
    >>> item = get_queue_messages('pipeline')[0]
    >>> print item.msg.as_string()
    From: aperson@example.com
    To: test@example.com
    Subject: My first post
    Message-ID: <first>
    Date: ...
    X-Mailman-Rule-Misses: approved; emergency; loop; administrivia;
        implicit-dest; max-recipients; max-size; news-moderation; no-subject;
        suspicious-header; member-moderation
    <BLANKLINE>

    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> dump_msgdata(item.msgdata)
    _parsemsg    : False
    envsender    : noreply@example.com
    ...


Held messages
=============

The list moderator sets the emergency flag on the mailing list.  The built-in
chain will now hold all posted messages, so nothing will show up in the
pipeline queue.
::

    >>> from mailman.chains.base import ChainNotification
    >>> def on_chain(event):
    ...     if isinstance(event, ChainNotification):
    ...         print event
    ...         print event.chain
    ...         print 'From: {0}\nTo: {1}\nMessage-ID: {2}'.format(
    ...             event.msg['from'], event.msg['to'],
    ...             event.msg['message-id'])

    >>> import zope.event
    >>> zope.event.subscribers.append(on_chain)

    >>> mlist.emergency = True
    >>> inject_message(mlist, msg)
    >>> incoming.run()
    <mailman.chains.hold.HoldNotification ...>
    <mailman.chains.hold.HoldChain ...>
    From: aperson@example.com
    To: test@example.com
    Message-ID: <first>

    >>> mlist.emergency = False


Discarded messages
==================

Another possibility is that the message would get immediately discarded.  The
built-in chain does not have such a disposition by default, so let's craft a
new chain and set it as the mailing list's start chain.
::

    >>> from mailman.chains.base import Chain, Link
    >>> from mailman.interfaces.chain import LinkAction
    >>> def make_chain(name, target_chain):
    ...     truth_rule = config.rules['truth']
    ...     target_chain = config.chains[target_chain]
    ...     test_chain = Chain(name, 'Testing {0}'.format(target_chain))
    ...     config.chains[test_chain.name] = test_chain
    ...     link = Link(truth_rule, LinkAction.jump, target_chain)
    ...     test_chain.append_link(link)
    ...     return test_chain

    >>> test_chain = make_chain('always-discard', 'discard')
    >>> mlist.start_chain = test_chain.name

    >>> msg.replace_header('message-id', '<second>')
    >>> inject_message(mlist, msg)
    >>> incoming.run()
    <mailman.chains.discard.DiscardNotification ...>
    <mailman.chains.discard.DiscardChain ...>
    From: aperson@example.com
    To: test@example.com
    Message-ID: <second>

    >>> del config.chains[test_chain.name]

..
    The virgin queue needs to be cleared out due to artifacts from the
    previous tests above.

    >>> virgin_queue = config.switchboards['virgin']
    >>> ignore = get_queue_messages('virgin')


Rejected messages
=================

Similar to discarded messages, a message can be rejected, or bounced back to
the original sender.  Again, the built-in chain doesn't support this so we'll
just create a new chain that does.

    >>> test_chain = make_chain('always-reject', 'reject')
    >>> mlist.start_chain = test_chain.name

    >>> msg.replace_header('message-id', '<third>')
    >>> inject_message(mlist, msg)
    >>> incoming.run()
    <mailman.chains.reject.RejectNotification ...>
    <mailman.chains.reject.RejectChain ...>
    From: aperson@example.com
    To: test@example.com
    Message-ID: <third>

The rejection message is sitting in the virgin queue waiting to be delivered
to the original sender.

    >>> len(virgin_queue.files)
    1
    >>> item = get_queue_messages('virgin')[0]
    >>> print item.msg.as_string()
    Subject: My first post
    From: test-owner@example.com
    To: aperson@example.com
