======================
Standard bulk delivery
======================

Mailman has several built in strategies for completing the actual delivery of
messages to the immediate upstream mail transport agent, which completes the
actual final delivery to recipients.

Bulk delivery attempts to deliver as few copies of the identical message as
possible to as many recipients as possible.  By grouping recipients this way,
bandwidth between Mailman and the MTA, and consequently between the MTA and
remote mail servers, can be greatly reduced.  The downside is the messages
cannot be personalized.  See `verp.txt`_ for an alternative strategy.

    >>> from mailman.mta.bulk import BulkDelivery

Delivery strategies must implement the proper interface.

    >>> bulk = BulkDelivery()

    >>> from mailman.interfaces.mta import IMailTransportAgentDelivery
    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> verifyObject(IMailTransportAgentDelivery, bulk)    
    True
