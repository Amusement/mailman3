Users
=====

The REST API can be used to add and remove users, add and remove user
addresses, and change their preferred address, passord, or name.  Users are
different than members; the latter represents an email address subscribed to a
specific mailing list.  Users are just people that Mailman knows about.

There are no users yet.
