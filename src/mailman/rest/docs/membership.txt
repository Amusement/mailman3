Membership
==========

The REST API can be used to subscribe and unsubscribe users to mailing lists.
A subscribed user is called a 'member'.  There is a top level collection that
returns all the members of all known mailing lists.

There are no mailing lists and no members yet.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/members')
    resource_type_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/#members
    start: None
    total_size: 0

We create a mailing list, which starts out with no members.

    >>> create_list('test-one@example.com')
    <mailing list "test-one@example.com" at ...>
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/members')
    resource_type_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/#members
    start: None
    total_size: 0
