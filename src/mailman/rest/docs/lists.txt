Mailing lists
=============

The REST API can be queried for the set of known mailing lists.  There is a
top level collection that can return all the mailing lists.  There aren't any
yet though.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/lists')
    resource_type_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/#mailing_lists
    start: None
    total_size: 0

Create a mailing list in a domain and it's accessible via the API.

    >>> from mailman.app.lifecycle import create_list
    >>> create_list('test-one@example.com')
    <mailing list "test-one@example.com" at ...>
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/lists')
    entry 0:
        fqdn_listname: test-one@example.com
        host_name: example.com
        http_etag: "..."
        list_name: test-one
        real_name: Test-one
        resource_type_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/#mailing_list
        self_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/mailing_lists/test-one@example.com
    resource_type_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/#mailing_lists
