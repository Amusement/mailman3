**                          changed to work on 1 command, take a list of
**                          valid commands, just pass on argv, and use
**                          execvp() Also threw in some useful feedback for
**                          when there's a failure, mainly for future
**                          debugging.

** 03-31-98 : John Viega    (viega@list.org)
**                          Consolidated all CGI wrappers into 1, removed
**                          checking the command name, (it was not real
**                          security anyway...) and changed it to use
**                          syslog on error.  This definitely doesn't have
**                          any of Hal's code left ;-)
