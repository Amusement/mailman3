GNU/LINUX ISSUES

GNU/Linux seems to be the most popular platform on which to run
Mailman, which really shouldn't be a big surprise.  Here are some
hints on getting Mailman to run on Linux:

If you are running secure_linux, you probably have restricted
hardlinks turned on.  Gergely Madarasz says that this not only
restricts hardlinks in /tmp, but also in any non +t directory.  This
can cause "Operation not permitted" errors in MailList.Save() -- you
will see a traceback.  You must turn restricted hardlinks off.
